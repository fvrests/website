Rosé Pine is a theme project with support for over 70 platforms. I work alongside [@mvllow](https://mellow.dev) and a growing community of contributors to maintain themes and documentation for the organization.

Rosé Pine aims to provide a calming, soft palette which can be adapted for various applications and which reduces eyestrain in varying light conditions, with loose design inspiration from [Solarized](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/) and other light-accommodative themes.

The project is also intended as an encouraging space for contributors to learn about code & theme building, and is open-source to serve as a resource to the community.
