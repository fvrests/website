Rosé Pine is a theme project with support for over 100 platforms. I tinker when I'm able amongst wiser and braver souls -- [@mvllow](https://mellow.dev) and a growing community of contributors -- to maintain themes and documentation for the organization.

In the context of the web theming space, Rosé Pine's palette tends toward calming and moody colors, with an adaptible nature well-suited to varying applications. Its three variants reduce eyestrain in diverse light conditions, with loose design inspiration from [Solarized](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/) and other light-accommodative themes.

Owing to the caring and generous efforts of a growing open-source community, Rosé Pine has become an encouraging medium through which contributors can learn about code & theme building.
